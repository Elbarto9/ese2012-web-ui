1.Explain how typical HTTP request is processed with the framework

The main HTTP requests are 'get' and 'post' respectively to fetch and to send data to URL.
Sinatra maps this requests with ruby code via routes/controllers. Usually the ruby code don't produce HTML itself, but
instead forwards to a view:

get "/" do
    haml :hello_world
end

The code above renders the file hello_world.haml. The controller manipulates the model and the view renders it.


2.Why should GET requests be idempotent

In opposition to post requests, get requests shouldn't change the data on the server. You shouldn't be able to change
them --> You can only read the data.


3.Where should you format data for rendering?

In the views. You should try to postpone formatting dates as late as possible to keep the separation between
controllers and views.
